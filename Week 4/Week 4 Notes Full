# ---------

# Strings
# -collection of alphabets, words, or other characters
#  - a bunch of characters put together
# -primitive data structures
# -building block for data manipulation
# - string is defined by a single/double quote '' or "" 

# ---------

# String operations (review)
# - concatation: putting strings together using + operator
# - *same as algebra....


# ---------

# Accessing characters in a string

# - Indexing
s = "computer"
print(s[0])
#indexing is done with integers 

# - Negative Indexing
a = "random"
print(a[-1])
#all the rules about indexing apply for negative and positive numbers

# - Range
a = "computer"
print(aString[0:3]) #index char 0, char 1, char 2
 #the last num is exclusive
 #the first num is inclusive

#the : called the splicing operator
#putting this at the beg or end will give you the rest of the string

# Example

aStr = "Hello World"

# print the first char of the word using two differrent methods

# print the first three chars of the word

# print the last four chars of the word

# print all but the first 5 chars

# ---------

# Testing Strings
# Check out "https://docs.python.org/2.5/lib/string-methods.html" for more!

print("is alpha")
a = "24"
print(a.isaplha())
a2 = "sunny"
print(a2.isalpha())
#alphanum checks if it alphabetic or numerical
# #is upper... checks for uppercase
# #is lower.. checks for lowercase
# endswith .. it sees if the last charac is equal to the parameter

print("endswith")
aString33 ="sunny"
print(aString33.isdigit())


# Example

aStr1 = "fall is "
aStr2 = "100%"
aStr2 = " the best"

"""
We want to combine the strings, only if the format is what we want...
1. String 1 is only alphabetic 
2. String 2
	a. The last char is %
	b. The rest of the chars are numeric
3. String 3 is uppercase
Write nested if statements to check these conditions, if they are all true, print the concatanation.
"""
print(aStr1.isalpha())


# ---------

# Other string functions

# - Strip
# removes whitespace before or after a word... not in the middle
print("strip")
aString = "                           word                "
print(aString.strip())
# - Upper and Lower
changes upper to lower and vice versa
print("strip")
aString = "word"
print(aString.upper())
# ---------

# Iterating through a string is a way that we can do - or /

# Example- Remove all the l's in the following string

oldString = "lilllltslatlllhurlsdlayl"

# ---------

# Practice Problems

# 1. Swap the letters in the following string
aStr1 = "The BEST kinD of coOKies are sugar. NO CAP."

# 2. Find how many instances of "abc" are in the following string
aStr2 = "abcabbcabbcabbcabcaabcabcadbcacbchabc"

# 3. Remove any subsequent occurrence of non-distinct characters in the following string. For example: aab becomes ab
aStr3 = "aaabbbcbbcaabbca"
